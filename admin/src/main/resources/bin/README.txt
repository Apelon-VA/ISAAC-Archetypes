generatePaArchetype.bat will generate an ISAAC-PA project for "VHA".  

A copy of this script should be made and edited to generate an ISAAC-PA
for "VHA-CIMI".

In the long run, we probably want a "template" generator script that
is self-documenting and then actual generator scripts for VHA and
VHA-CIMI that can be reliably re-run.
